  <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
  <p>
    Getting started is simple, you can browse the #project-hub channel to find a project, or submit one of your own ideas there.
    Once you find a project you are suitable with, you can go to the github repository of that respective project.
    Now heres the important part, make sure while forking the project, you disable the "Fork main branch only" option. You will see why
    this is important in the "Submitting Contributions" section.
    <br /><br />
    Explaining a little about the format of our repositories, generally we have a main branch, and a dev branch. The dev branch holds 
    the latest commits and changes, while the main branch holds the stable releases. The benefit of seperating them as such is, this allows
    us to have a CI/CD pipeline, which in leymann terms, means that whenever the code on the main branch changes, all active deployments of
    that respective project switch to the new version. This allows us to develop and code beside the actual project deployments without hindering it.
