  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>
    To keep it simple, there are no prerequisites.
    <br /><br />
    Ok, so while there are no prerequisites, an individual may need to utilize tools such as Git, Github etc to be able to
    contribute. The reason these are not mentioned as a prerequisite is because, in Sourceware Labs, we are always available
    to help you. You can ask questions to all the members of the community, or, if you have some specific question, pertaining to
    a project, or tool, feel free to ping the Project Leads (@project-lead) or Admins and theyll be able to help you.

  <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
  <p>
    Getting started is simple, you can browse the #project-hub channel to find a project, or submit one of your own ideas there.
    Once you find a project you are suitable with, you can go to the github repository of that respective project.
    Now heres the important part, make sure while forking the project, you disable the "Fork main branch only" option. You will see why
    this is important in the "Submitting Contributions" section.
    <br /><br />
    Explaining a little about the format of our repositories, generally we have a main branch, and a dev branch. The dev branch holds 
    the latest commits and changes, while the main branch holds the stable releases. The benefit of seperating them as such is, this allows
    us to have a CI/CD pipeline, which in leymann terms, means that whenever the code on the main branch changes, all active deployments of
    that respective project switch to the new version. This allows us to develop and code beside the actual project deployments without hindering it.

  <h2>Submitting Contributions</h2>
  <p>
    Every project has a certain Issues which you can contribute to, or if you have your own ideas or issues, we encourage
    you to create a Github Issue and communicate with other people on its plausibility.
    <br /><br />
    To contribute to a project, you can create a Pull Request(PR), you should keep in mind that you should not make a PR to the main
    branch, a PR should be created to the dev branch generally. Also have a good description of the PR.
    <br />
    Ex: feature: some feature <br />
    Ex: bug: some bug <br />
    Make sure to check the PR for any changes the Project Leaders ask for and either talk to them if you have any problems.
